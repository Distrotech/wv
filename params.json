{"name":"Wv","tagline":"","body":"Read INSTALL for install information, basically pretty standard\r\nrequirements for a modern *NIX program plus libwmf to convert\r\nwmf files to something useful.\r\n\r\nThere are now a small herd of programs based upon libwv. AbiWord\r\n(http://www.abisource.com/) is the most interesting and complete\r\none that we're aware of.\r\n\r\n1) wvWare: this is what you are looking for, it converts\r\nWord 2,6,7,8,9 files to html and latex. The Word 2 conversion\r\nis still incomplete (no formatting), but it will do a passable\r\njob extracting the text, which is what you probably want anyway.\r\n\r\n2) The small army of helper scripts:\r\n\twvHtml\r\n\twvLatex\r\n\twvCleanLatex\r\n\twvPS\r\n\twvDVI\r\n\twvPDF\r\n\twvMime\r\n\twvText\r\n\t...\r\n   Do: `man wvXXX` where \"XXX\" is Html, Latex, etc.. for more information\r\n\r\n3) wvSummary, displays the summary information stream of *all*\r\nole2 files, i.e Excel, PowerPoint, Visio, Access etc etc etc,\r\nI've sent wvSummary as a patch to the file program, so that utility\r\nshould in the future have this ability to know what windows application\r\ncreated the ole2 document. `man wvSummary`\r\n\r\n4) wvVersion, outputs the version of the word format which the document\r\nis stored as. `man wvVersion`\r\n\r\nAlso...\r\n\r\n5) There are helper applications in the helper-scripts dir\r\nthat allow both lynx and netscape to view word 8 docs easily\r\n\r\n6) The webpage is at http://wvware.sourceforge.net/\r\n\r\nFinally...\r\n\r\n7) libwv can be used as a library by third party programs, abiword\r\nuses it as its word importer, and kword may use it in the future.\r\nwvWare is a sample application for the use of wv, as is abiword\r\nitself. The library (will be some day) documented in the \r\nDocumentation dir\r\n\r\n8) The config file format is (beginning to be) documented in the\r\nDocumentation dir, so it may be possible to achieve the conversion\r\nthat you desire without writing your own program. It also allows\r\nyou to customize the html and latex output to your own tastes.\r\n\r\nSome possible \"fun\" projects:\r\n\r\n(Projects for someone to try out with libwv include, could be\r\ncommercial applications)\r\n\r\na) wvMacroRemove, deletes macros out of word files, for the security\r\nconcious\r\n\r\nb) wvFastToFull, converts fastsaved docs to full saved, shrinking their\r\nsize usually by quite a lot, and also making them safe for security \r\nconsious firms\r\n\r\nc) wvCrackProtection, take the wvDecrypt97 code and make a cracker\r\nthat uses the rc4 algorithm and other known bit of information to\r\ncrack word documents, ala http://www.crak.com\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
